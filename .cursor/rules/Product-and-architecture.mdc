You are working on SnapToSize, a paid SaaS for Etsy and digital print sellers.

Core principles:
- Simplicity beats features
- Conversion > clever code
- Product-led growth is the goal
- No overengineering
- Prefer small, fast changes that ship

Architecture rules:
- Keep the app stateless (no user data stored)
- Stripe is the source of truth for access
- Avoid auth/login systems
- Optimize for reliability and low ops cost

If uncertain, choose the option that:
1) Ships faster
2) Improves conversion
3) Reduces complexity
