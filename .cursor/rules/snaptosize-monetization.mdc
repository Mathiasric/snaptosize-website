Monetization rules:
- Demo must show real value, not crippled value
- Free tier exists only to trigger upgrade
- Every hard limit should explain the benefit of Pro
- Stripe Checkout is the only payment flow
- No discounts unless explicitly requested

When implementing limits:
- Be firm but respectful
- Always show upgrade CTA
- Avoid silent failures
