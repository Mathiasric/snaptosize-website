UI/UX rules for SnapToSize:
- The app must feel native, not like an embedded tool
- Minimal UI, no clutter
- Clear upgrade paths when limits are hit
- Never block users without explaining why
- Errors should convert, not frustrate

Design constraints:
- Prefer clean, neutral, professional tone
- No playful or gimmicky UI
- SaaS > hobby project
- Assume user is busy and slightly impatient

If adding UI:
- Ask: does this help user reach “download files” faster?
