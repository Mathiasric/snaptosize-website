# Rewrite Copy for Etsy Sellers

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever the user:

- Asks to **rewrite, tighten, or improve copy** (headlines, bullets, body text, CTAs, emails, in-app messages, tooltips, or onboarding flows).
- Mentions **Etsy sellers**, **printables**, **digital downloads**, or **SnapToSize**.
- Wants copy that **converts** but **avoids marketing fluff**.
- Emphasizes **time saved**, **reduced mistakes**, or **avoiding rework and support headaches**.

If the request is generic conversion copy with no Etsy or SnapToSize context, follow these principles but keep references to Etsy out unless the user adds them.

## Core Principles

When rewriting copy:

1. **Default audience**
   - Assume the reader is an **Etsy seller** (especially selling digital prints or printables) who is:
     - Busy, slightly impatient.
     - Decent at tech but not a developer.
     - Worried about **getting orders wrong**, **wasting time on resizing**, and **answering customer complaints**.

2. **Clarity over cleverness**
   - Prefer simple, concrete language over metaphors or hype.
   - Avoid buzzwords, clichés, and vague promises.
   - The reader should understand **what it does**, **who it’s for**, and **why it matters** in seconds.

3. **Conversion without fluff**
   - Emphasize:
     - **Time saved** (e.g. “turn sizing requests into a 30‑second task”).
     - **Mistakes avoided** (wrong sizes, misprints, refunds, angry messages).
     - **Emotional relief** (fewer “help, it doesn’t fit” messages).
   - Avoid:
     - Over-the-top claims (“explode your sales”, “insane results”).
     - Empty adjectives (“amazing”, “incredible”, “revolutionary”) unless paired with specifics.

4. **Skimmable structure**
   - Use:
     - Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences).
     - Descriptive subheadings.
     - Bullets for benefits and features.
   - Make it easy for a scanning reader to catch the main points.

5. **Specific > generic**
   - Prefer specific outcomes:
     - “Resize your art to 20+ standard print sizes in one go”
     - “Cut customer sizing questions by half”
   - Anchor benefits in **real tasks** Etsy sellers recognize:
     - Listing new sizes.
     - Making custom orders.
     - Updating old listings.

6. **Respect the product rules**
   - If SnapToSize or this project has **limits or upgrade paths**, explain them clearly and calmly.
   - Turn limitations into **clear reasons to upgrade** (e.g. more files per batch, larger sizes, more formats).

## Rewrite Workflow

When asked to rewrite or optimize copy:

1. **Identify the goal**
   - Determine what the text is trying to do:
     - Explain what the tool is.
     - Get users to sign up or upgrade.
     - Get Etsy sellers to try a feature.
     - Reduce confusion or support tickets.

2. **Clarify the promise**
   - Restate the main promise in 1–2 simple sentences:
     - What problem it solves.
     - For whom.
     - What result they can expect.

3. **Center time saved and mistakes avoided**
   - Make sure the core copy highlights:
     - Fewer manual resizing steps.
     - Fewer “wrong size” issues.
     - Fewer back-and-forth customer messages.

4. **Restructure for scanning**
   - Introduce:
     - A clear headline.
     - A short supporting sentence.
     - 3–5 bullet points for key benefits.
   - Optionally add a short “How it works” section if it increases clarity.

5. **Tighten the language**
   - Remove filler words and weak qualifiers (very, really, super, kind of).
   - Replace vague claims with concrete ones.
   - Shorten long sentences; prefer one idea per sentence.

6. **Write a direct CTA**
   - Use clear, action-oriented CTAs:
     - “Upload your artwork and see all sizes.”
     - “Generate print‑ready files for your Etsy listings.”
     - “Upgrade to resize full collections in one go.”

7. **Provide variations when helpful**
   - For headlines and CTAs, offer 2–3 strong options with slightly different angles:
     - Speed-focused.
     - Error-reduction-focused.
     - Peace-of-mind-focused.

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Calm, confident, professional. Not cute or jokey.
- **Voice**: Second person (“you”) addressing Etsy sellers directly.
- **Length**: As short as possible while staying clear.
- **Jargon**: Avoid technical jargon unless Etsy sellers would naturally use it (e.g. “aspect ratio”, “DPI” is acceptable with a quick explanation if needed).

When in doubt, ask: **Would a busy Etsy seller understand this in 5 seconds and see why it helps them today?**

## Output Format

Unless the user specifies a different format, respond with:

- **Sectioned copy** using `###` headings for:
  - A main headline.
  - Short intro/body.
  - Bullets for key benefits.
  - Optional “How it works” or “Who it’s for”.
  - One or more CTA lines or button labels.
- **Brief rationale** (2–4 bullet points) explaining:
  - How the rewrite improves clarity.
  - How it supports conversion.
  - How it emphasizes time saved and mistakes avoided.

If the user only wants a single sentence or headline, skip sections and give **1–3 options** plus a one-line rationale.

## Examples

**Key benefits**
- **Save time**: Generate all your common print sizes in a single run.

- **Happier buyers**: Fewer “it doesn’t fit” messages and refunds.

**Input**

> You’ve hit the free limit. Upgrade now to unlock unlimited features and turbocharge your Etsy business!
